# Light RAT-SQL 🧠

A simplified and optimized variant of Microsoft's RAT-SQL for the text-to-SQL task.  
This version reduces relation complexity while maintaining strong generalization on the Spider dataset.

## 🔍 Overview

**Light RAT-SQL** is based on the original [RAT-SQL](https://github.com/microsoft/rat-sql) architecture.  
It introduces:
- Fewer relation types (reduced from 50+ to 7)
- Improved specialization per attention head
- Faster training and inference with preserved accuracy

This code was developed as part of my PhD research in NLP and semantic parsing (2021–2025).
